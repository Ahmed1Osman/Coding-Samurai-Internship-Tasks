## Recommendation System

### Overview
This project implements a recommendation system that suggests products to users based on their previous preferences. By analyzing user behavior and preferences, it enhances user experience on e-commerce platforms.

### Features
- Personalized recommendations
- User behavior analysis
- Integrated web deployment for real-time access

### How It Works
The recommendation system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques, employing user-item interactions to predict items that a user might like.

## Flower Prediction

### Overview
In this project, I developed a flower prediction model that classifies various flower species based on their features. This model can be used in botanical applications and educational tools.

### Features
- Classification of flower species
- Visualization of prediction results
- User-friendly interface for interaction

### How It Works
Using machine learning algorithms, the model analyzes features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width to classify flowers accurately.

## Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of customer reviews, allowing businesses to gauge public opinion on their products. It can assist in improving customer satisfaction and understanding market trends.

### Features
- Analysis of text reviews to determine sentiment
- Visualization of sentiment trends over time
- Ability to handle large datasets for comprehensive insights

### How It Works
The sentiment analysis tool employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques, using pre-trained models to classify reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on the text.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (for web deployment)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
